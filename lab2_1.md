## Day 2 (in-person), section 1: working with hardware in Arduino

_Today, we'll get to program actual hardware, and including using real-world versions of the parts you used in the simulator._

Since our focus is on the embedded programming aspect, we will be using this pre-built custom circuit board:

It has an ESP32-S3 microcontroller in a socketed daughterboard with onboard switch and LED.
The carrier board contains the LED ring (which you'd be familiar with from the simulator), a light sensor, and OLED display.
There's a few more devices that won't be part of the core lab, but if you have time you can play with then in the extra section.


### Activity 2.1: Hardware Bring-up


### Activity 2.2: Porting over the LED Ring


### Activity 2.3: Reading the Light Sensor


### Activity 2.4: OLED Display

_Let us know when you get to this part, and we'll give you an OLED display and right-angle USB connector._


### Activity 2.5: Putting it all together: Ring Light Sensor with Numeric Display
